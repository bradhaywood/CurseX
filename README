NAME
    App::CurseX - Curses-based Text Editor

DESCRIPTION
    Ever wanted to use a text editor that wasn't as good as vim, lacked most
    of its features, had zero syntax highlighting, but was written in pure
    perl? App::CurseX is a curses-based (console) text editor written in
    nothing but Perl.
